    <h2>1) Scope of Application</h2>

    <p><b>1.1</b> These General Terms and Conditions (hereinafter "GTC") of Mahler Filmproduktion GmbH (hereinafter "Provider") apply to all contracts for the provision of digital content that a consumer or entrepreneur (hereinafter "Customer") concludes with the Provider regarding the content described in the Provider's online shop. The inclusion of the Customer's own terms and conditions is hereby rejected unless otherwise agreed.</p>

    <p><b>1.2</b> A consumer within the meaning of these GTC is any natural person who enters into a legal transaction for purposes that are predominantly neither commercial nor self-employed.</p>

    <p><b>1.3</b> An entrepreneur within the meaning of these GTC is a natural or legal person or a partnership with legal capacity who, when concluding a legal transaction, acts in the exercise of their commercial or self-employed professional activity.</p>

    <p><b>1.4</b> The subject of the contract may be – depending on the Provider's content description – either the one-time provision of digital content or the regular provision of digital content (hereinafter "subscription contract"). In the subscription contract, the Provider undertakes to provide the Customer with the contractually owed digital content for the duration of the agreed contract term at the contractually agreed time intervals.</p>

    <h2>2) Conclusion of Contract</h2>

    <p><b>2.1</b> The content described in the Provider's online shop does not constitute binding offers on the part of the Provider but serves to enable the Customer to submit a binding offer.</p>

    <p><b>2.2</b> The Customer can submit the offer via the online order form integrated into the Provider's online shop. After placing the selected content in the virtual shopping cart and going through the electronic ordering process, the Customer submits a legally binding contract offer regarding the content in the shopping cart by clicking the button that concludes the ordering process.</p>

    <p><b>2.3</b> The Provider can accept the Customer's offer within five days by sending the Customer a written order confirmation or an order confirmation in text form (fax or email), by providing the Customer with the ordered content, or by requesting payment from the Customer after placing the order.</p>

    <p><b>2.4</b> When selecting a payment method offered by PayPal, payment is processed via the payment service provider PayPal (Europe) S.à r.l. et Cie, S.C.A., 22-24 Boulevard Royal, L-2449 Luxembourg, subject to PayPal's terms of use.</p>

    <p><b>2.5</b> When submitting an offer via the Provider's online order form, the contract text is saved by the Provider after the contract is concluded and transmitted to the Customer in text form (e.g., email, fax, or letter) after the Customer's order is sent.</p>

    <h2>3) Right of Withdrawal</h2>

    <p>Consumers are generally entitled to a right of withdrawal. More detailed information on the right of withdrawal can be found in the Provider's cancellation policy.</p>

    <h2>4) Prices and Payment Terms</h2>

    <p><b>4.1</b> The prices stated by the Provider are total prices and include statutory VAT.</p>

    <p><b>4.2</b> For payments in countries outside the European Union, additional costs may be incurred in individual cases that are not the responsibility of the Provider and are to be borne by the Customer. These include, for example, costs for money transfer by credit institutions (e.g., transfer fees, exchange rate fees).</p>

    <p><b>4.3</b> The payment options are indicated in the Provider's online shop.</p>

    <p><b>4.4</b> When selecting the direct debit payment method via Stripe, payment is processed by the payment service provider Stripe Payments Europe Ltd., 1 Grand Canal Street Lower, Grand Canal Dock, Dublin, Ireland ("Stripe"). Stripe will debit the invoice amount from the Customer's bank account after a SEPA direct debit mandate has been issued.</p>

    <p><b>4.5</b> When selecting the credit card payment method via Stripe, the invoice amount is due immediately upon conclusion of the contract. Payment processing is carried out by Stripe.</p>

    <h2>5) Provision of Content</h2>

    <p>Digital content is provided to the Customer as follows:</p>

    <p>- via direct access through the Provider's website</p>

    <h2>6) Granting of Usage Rights</h2>

    <p><b>6.1</b> Unless otherwise stated in the content description in the Provider's online shop, the Provider grants the Customer the non-exclusive right to use the provided content for private and commercial purposes.</p>

    <p><b>6.2</b> Passing on the content to third parties or making copies for third parties outside the scope of these GTC is not permitted unless the Provider has agreed to the transfer of the contractual license to the third party.</p>

    <p><b>6.3</b> If the contract relates to the one-time provision of digital content, the granting of rights only becomes effective when the Customer has paid the contractually owed remuneration in full.</p>

    <h2>7) Contract Duration and Termination for Subscription Contracts</h2>

    <p><b>7.1</b> Subscription contracts are concluded for an indefinite period and can be terminated by the Customer at any time without observing a notice period.</p>

    <p><b>7.2</b> The right to extraordinary termination for good cause remains unaffected.</p>

    <p><b>7.3</b> Terminations can be made in writing, in text form (e.g., by email), or in electronic form via the cancellation facility (cancellation button) provided by the Provider on its website.</p>

    <h2>8) Warranty for Defects</h2>

    <p>The statutory warranty for defects applies.</p>

    <h2>9) Special Conditions for Processing Digital Content According to Customer Specifications</h2>

    <p><b>9.1</b> If, according to the content of the contract, the Provider owes not only the provision of digital content but also its processing according to certain specifications of the Customer, the Customer must provide the Provider with all content required for the processing, such as texts, images, or graphics, in the file formats, formatting, image, and file sizes specified by the Provider and grant the Provider the usage rights required for this.</p>

    <p><b>9.2</b> The Customer indemnifies the Provider against claims by third parties that they may assert against the Provider in connection with a violation of their rights through the contractual use of the Customer's content by the Provider.</p>

    <p><b>9.3</b> The Provider reserves the right to refuse processing orders if the content provided by the Customer for this purpose violates legal or official prohibitions or public morals.</p>

    <h2>10) Applicable Law</h2>

    <p><b>10.1</b> The law of the Federal Republic of Germany shall apply to all legal relationships between the parties, excluding the laws on the international sale of movable goods. For consumers, this choice of law shall only apply insofar as the protection granted is not withdrawn by mandatory provisions of the law of the state in which the consumer has their habitual residence.</p>

    <p><b>10.2</b> If the licensee is a merchant, a legal entity under public law, or a special fund under public law with its registered office in the territory of the Federal Republic of Germany, the exclusive place of jurisdiction for all disputes arising from this contract shall be the registered office of the licensor.</p>

    <h2>11) Alternative Dispute Resolution</h2>

    <p>The Provider is neither obliged nor willing to participate in dispute resolution proceedings before a consumer arbitration board.</p>
